#### Who did you help this week?

* I did some analysis of the DVS data that has been interesting 


#### Who helped you this week?

* :sparkles: Kirstie :sparkles:

* Hieu and Darren helped me by giving me material for the Whitakerlab blog.
* Barbara helped a lot yesterday with getting me started on the DVS project
* Amerik gave me a pass to the office!
* People in general have been very friendly

#### What did you achieve?

* Introduced myself to a lot of people!
* Started an introduction to Neuroimaging reading list
*
* Got a good start on processing DVS files

#### What did you struggle with?

* Convincing people to say something for the blog
* Understanding neuroimaging. I don't feel like I've gotten very far
* Time management? Handling having a lot of different things to think about (and remember to do!)

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finishing running and wiki-ing structural covariance analysis (+ maybe a python notebook?) (a few days I think)
* Exploring the DVS dataset (depends how far I want to go)


#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* With the structural covariance analysis- in particular I'm wondering how much detail to go into in explanation.
