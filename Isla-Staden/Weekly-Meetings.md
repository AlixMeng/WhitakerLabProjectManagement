  * KW: As discussed in meeting, send email to A & J w numbers dropped by various criteria
  	* After a second look at the API, although a large number of BMJ articles do only have this "journal article" tag I'm not convinced that many of them are what we would want to count anyway. I'm therefore going to stop worrying and let A go ahead and filter by "research article".

#### What did you achieve?

* I've cleaned up a lot of the work I have done on the DAS project.

#### What did you struggle with?

* This week has been a heavyhanded lesson in "tidy up and explain while you go along" and "explaining what you've done takes longer than you expect it to"

### Date: 18th August 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

* I proofread Kirstie's newsletter.
  * KW: YAAAAY! Thank you! :sparkles: :balloon:
  * KW: and you gave an awesome presentation! :star2:
  * KW: AND you gave R a bunch of interesting resources (even if they aren't all that helpful)

#### Who helped you this week?

* R gave me some advice on topic modelling
* HH gave me a lot of suggestions on document clustering
* Kirstie gave me guidance with my slides

#### What did you achieve?

* Report on the das project
  * KW: which was great! Well done!

* Methods of clustering das
  * Topic Modelling- interesting but not super useful
  * minhash?
  * blue scores/ngram distributions
  * doc2vec ([has gensim implemenatation](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/develop/docs/notebooks/doc2vec-IMDB.ipynb))
    * KW: Take a look at this github repo if it's of any use! https://github.com/CDIPS-AI-2017/pensieve
* I want to get all of the das work into shape, so that we can put it aside until the new data comes in.
  * KW: YES - lets set 1st September as a day to move onto a new schedule of work. DAS won't be done, but you can deprioritise it.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I would love to work with her on the data availability statements, but if she's busy I think I can move forward without her. There are a lot of people at the Turing with expertise in relevant areas who I could ask
* I'm going to keep polishing the jupyter notebooks I've been using for analysis and I will probably ask her some time next week to give feedback
  * KW: I'm in Toronto next week, but lets try for a collaborative doc that I can add comments to

#### Any other topics

* Maybe we should discuss when to move on from focusing on DAS to focusing on BNIP
  * KW: Yes - sorry to rush out on you. High priorty conversation for when I'm back
* How does Kirstie generate her markdown calendar? It's super usfeul.

### Date: 3rd August 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

* I recommended the API to B on the fragile families project
  * KW: That's great :tada:

#### Who helped you this week?

* Kirstie, big time. Gave me so much help on my mozfest, mozilla open leadership and opencon applications
  * KW: Woooo hooo! :sparkles:
    * Can we add these to the resources page for the website?
    * To do for KW: merge in Mozilla mini grant PR
* AH sent over some new data availability statements

#### What did you achieve?

* Three applications! oof.
  * KW: :muscle: WAY TO GO.
* Took a look at the new das data

#### What did you struggle with?

* Writing applications- every time I read some thing back I flinch

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* The das project seems to have almost spiraled out of control. Needs explanation now, much more than analyses
  * KW: Sounds like a great plan. Hold [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy) in mind and "aim to write a shorter letter" so we can communicate all the work you've done clearly.
  * Build the report in either LaTeX or markdown - whichever works best.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I could use some guidance on what the EPMC team needs to know
  * KW: Great question - as discussed, stay focused on the errors in DAS & get those fixed first

#### Any other topics

* Have a full and useful csv now

#### What did you struggle with?

* I think I feel out of my depth with this analysis in a more serious way than usual
  * KW: This is a very appropriate feeling! We're asking you to do a whooole bunch of new things. And with great power (big data, big statistical models) comes great responsibility! It's very easy to do crazy things with statistics!!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* There are plenty of remaining csv analysis questions.
* I find myself wondering about potential usefulness of contentmine
* I really would like to try and apply some data science to separating positive and negative das

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Advice
  * KW: YOU. ROCK. And are doing an amazing job. And all your caution around the analyses are spot on :smile:

#### Any other topics


### Date: 6th July 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

* Fixed Kirstie's chair so it doesn't lean back
  * KW: ***SO*** helpful.
* I think I lent someone a pen

This week I actually did move the mugs left in the sink to the dishwasher.

* KW: *sigh* people suck. But thank you! :raised_hands:

#### Who helped you this week?

BMcG gave me a lot of support writing the DAS report. Also my brother and dad let me test run my explanation on them. It's good to try and explain what you're doing to other people!

* KW: AWESOME! That's great! :clap: :sparkles:

#### What did you achieve?

* Finished the report
  * KW: It looks fantastic - super helpful - well done :balloon: :cake:

    These two sentences make me SO HAPPY:
    > We've checked the contents of ten data-availability statements against the articles online, all ten were indeed present in the online text.  
    > We've also checked seven articles without this tag to make sure they didn't have data-availability statements. They did not.
* Started reading up on brain network analysis

#### What did you struggle with?

* Microsoft office :boar:
  * ***Action for KW***: Get Isla a copy of the evil office. :heavy_check_mark: Done - sent invite from personal account that can be shared with up to 5 people.
* Mostly this was a good week
  * KW: AWESOME :star2:

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I have a short program to write for DAS project
* I need to finish the jupyter notebook that I started to show problems with the EPMC API, although we may be able to ask them directly now
* Get a testing script started
* I think now is a good time for me to learn some more about network neuroscience

* KW: These all sound great - if you want to implement anything with the GAP study data that would be super fun, but keeping on in this general direction is perfect.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* not sure, maybe with network neuroscience resources? I've been using the book and reading list
  * KW: I think I need to get you some feedback on the blog post because that would be great to ship out and there are a few edits I'd like to see. Totally my fault that they're not submitted yet :eye_roll:

#### Any other topics


### Date: 13th June 2017

#### Who did you help this week?



#### Who helped you this week?

MO gave me an intro to testing code

#### What did you achieve?

* Determined why there are so many 0 reference articles!

#### What did you struggle with?

* Replace this text with a bullet point list of where you struggled this week.
* It's ok if your list is only one bullet point long!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finish writing DAS report
* If I get time I'd like to start testing BNIP

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* If possible, ask R about the incorrect reference counts on the API


### Date: 2nd June 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

Replace this text with a one/two sentence description of who you helped this week and how.

#### Who helped you this week?

Replace this text with a one/two sentence description of who helped you this week and how.

* These are always the hardest two. Why? Is there something wrong with me?

  * KW: No! Definitely not wrong with you. These are super odd questions to ask (but important I think!) Keep an eye on all the ways in which you're helping out. Moving forwards on the DAS project and the Brain Networks in Python code is really amazing!

#### What did you achieve?

* This has been a slow week, but I familiarised myself with the eupubmed API and with contentmine.
  * KW: GREAT! [Just keep pushing](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) :smile:
* By end of today I'll upload the new blog post!
  * (KW: Moved from plans for next week! YEAH!)

#### What did you struggle with?

* One thing that's been tricky this week is working without with Kirstie (since she's out of the country). I have relied on being able to go over to her desk and bug her.
  * KW: Yes. This is definitely harder. Let's see if Gitter is useful:
    * General questions in the [WhitakerLab Lobby](https://gitter.im/WhitakerLab/Lobby)
    * Brain Networks in Python questions in the [BrainNetworksInPython](https://gitter.im/WhitakerLab/BrainNetworksInPython) room :smile:

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Well there're some things I ought to do for the DAS project- i.e producing a presentation about my findings on the pubmed api/dataset/article contradictions (this from last week :moyai:) and taking a look at the new dataset.
  * KW: I think this is the really important thing to cross off the list by the next time we talk. Otherwise it's going to just keep hanging over us :unamused:
* I would like to sort of get a start on testing next week. I *want* to pull everything in Brain Networks in Python together and start permuting/ making ever prettier figures, but it would be wiser to get the hang of testing before I rush into everything else.
  * KW: Yes, lets go for a marathon not a sprint on this front :fist:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I need her to pedal hard and raise good money for aids! :mountain_bicyclist::leaves:
* It would be great if she could give me some pointers on learning testing
  * KW TODO: Put you in touch with Martin

#### Any other topics

 ### Date: 26th May 2017

 #### Who did you help this week?

 Hmmm.

* KW: Practical help of refactoring the Brains Networks in Python code is helping *everyone* who wants to use the code in the future!
     (which may only be a couple of people, but that's still REALLY helpful)

#### Who helped you this week?

 Kirstie gave me a lot of life-saving help with the Brain Networks in Python stuff

#### What did you achieve?

* Confirmed innacuracies in xml data for DAS
* Got a lot of things working nicely in Brain Networks in Python

#### What did you struggle with?

* Although I've found it easy to describe graph theory and python, I'm struggling to talk about the motivations for this sort of work
* Earlier in the week with the DAS issues I lost optimism

#### What would you like to work on next week?

  * I've really enjoyed the Brain Networks in python stuff. It seems to me that there is a lot more work to be done there in terms of modularising and introducing tests. (weeks plural?)
    * KW: Action for Kirstie - introduce Isla to Martin O'Reilly because testing would be AMAAAAAZING :sparkles: :sparkles: :sparkles:
  * I'd like to take a shot at the pubmed API (a day or two)
  * I should write up the data checking I did so that BMcG can pass it on to IH (a few hours)

 #### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

  * Let's really think about this. I will still probably need to ask a bunch of questions about these scripts - via github issues as discussed.
  * I guess I'm a little afraid that I'll run out of stuff to do, especially if the DAS project doesn't work out.
  * KW: Some ideas:
    * Visualise the correlation matrices sorted in different ways - eg by module or topologically by x, y, z
    * Use Force Atlas layout to visualise the topology of the network
    * Permutation testing between groups (Big job! Woooo!)

#### Any other topics

 Think about https://science.mozilla.org/blog/mini-grant-cfp!


### Date: 19th May 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

* Helped HH by proofreading his fellowship application
  * KW: VERY helpful!

#### Who helped you this week?

* BMcG gave me a lot of good advice about what to expect from articles data, techniques to use with the large xml files.
  * KW: Great stuff

#### What did you achieve?

* For [WhitakerLab issue 19](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/issues/19) I got the first two wrappers working, have been writing my comments as I go :carousel_horse: :sparkles:
  * KW: WAY TO GO! Thank you!
* For the DAS project I learnt quite a lot about the data, produced some nice graphs. :art:
  * KW: They look great...although not what we'd expect from the data :unamused:

#### What did you struggle with?

* Understanding the structural covariance network analysis with respect to brain science
  * KW: Definitely difficult if you can't access the papers!! Try [Unpaywall](http://unpaywall.org/) and see if there are green open access versions of the papers. Here's a [bunch of information](http://osc.cam.ac.uk/open-access) about open access at Cambridge if you're interested.
* TypeErrors :moyai:
  * KW: WELL DONE!
* I feel that this week I got bogged down a lot in programming issues
  * KW: Just keep pushing! :punch:

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I'd like to get the structural covariance blog written up (:watch: a couple of days. There is quite a lot to do here, not just in terms of getting the visualisations going, but also explaining (and understanding!) what is going on.
  * KW: GREAT! Thank you.
* For the DAS project I still need to check a sample of the data for accuracy (:watch:  a few hours, I fear)
  * KW: Yes, great plan. I'd suggest starting with papers that have a lot of references and are open access. Eg from PlosOne.
* Try to estimate how long each task will take.
  * KW: If you figure this out, please do let me know :neutral_face:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Would benefit from talking about structural covariance networks, where the data comes from etc. (:watch: maybe an hour some time next week?)
  * KW: absolutely.

### Date: 12th May 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

* I did some analysis of the DAS data that has been interesting
  * KW: Yaaaaay! Super exciting!
  * KW Q: What is Beautiful Soup!? Where's the name from?
    * IS: It seems to come from Alice in Wonderland, see [here](http://www.authorama.com/alice-in-wonderland-10.html), I'm still not really sure why.

#### Who helped you this week?

* :sparkles: Kirstie :sparkles:
* Hieu and Darren helped me by giving me material for the Whitakerlab blog.
* Barbara helped a lot yesterday with getting me started on the DVS project
* Amerik gave me a pass to the office!
* People in general have been very friendly

#### What did you achieve?

* Introduced myself to a lot of people!
* Started an introduction to Neuroimaging reading list
* Got a good start on processing DVS files
  * KW: YAAAAY! :sparkling_heart:
    * Processed xml file, got distribution of dates of articles, journal titles look sensible! YAAAAY (again).

#### What did you struggle with?

* Convincing people to say something for the blog
  * KW: Possible suggestion for next time is to not make the write up of the conversations public, it could be a report rather than a public facing blog post.
  * Interesting challenge between not wanting to bother people and writing something that (potentially) many others will see!
* Understanding neuroimaging. I don't feel like I've gotten very far
* Time management? Handling having a lot of different things to think about (and remember to do!)

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finishing running and wiki-ing structural covariance analysis (+ maybe a python notebook?) (a few days I think)
  * KW: Work in jupyter notebook to demonstrate use of code. Copy over data from PNAS paper to use as example input etc. Can also be used for code tests (either now or in the future).
* Exploring the DVS dataset (depends how far I want to go)
  * KW: Keep exploring! See what's there!
  * Next step is to write out the data in a cleaner format (eg csv file). Meeting planned with Barbara next week.
  * Possibly move on to doing analyses (although depends on how much time the cleaning takes).


#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* With the structural covariance analysis- in particular I'm wondering how much detail to go into in explanation.
  * KW: See above about jupyter notebook - best explanation is through demonstration! If you can write up a blog post that has some screen shots of the jupyter notebook that would be great.
  * Try not to write too much! The goal of the blog post is to help readers understand why they might want to do structural covariance network analyses. Sections might include:
    * Motivation
    * Building the network
    * Creating a graph
    * Calculating global and nodal measures
    * Visualising the network
  * There's a challenge for the blog post around how to include a small amount of useful background information motivating *why* we would want to do structural covariance network analyses....take a look at the Network Neuroscience reading list - in particular Alexander-Bloch et al's Nature Review's Neuroscience paper in 2013:  [doi: 10.1038/nrn3465](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n5/full/nrn3465.html)
    * Side note: please add this paper to the Network Neuroscience reading list.

#### Any other topics

What's going to happen in June? How should I spend my time while Kirstie's is traveling?
* KW: Take ownership of DVS project - really explore the data and look for insights. Also potentially explore network measures between two groups (probably by implementing permutation test between them).
