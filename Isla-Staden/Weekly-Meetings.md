# Weekly Meetings

* [19th May 2017](#date-19th-may-2017)
* [12th May 2017](#date-12th-may-2017)

### Date: 19th May 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

* Helped HH by proofreading his fellowship application
  * KW: VERY helpful!

#### Who helped you this week?

* BMcG gave me a lot of good advice about what to expect from articles data, techniques to use with the large xml files.
  * KW: Great stuff

#### What did you achieve?

* For [WhitakerLab issue 19](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/WhitakerLabProjectManagement/issues/19) I got the first two wrappers working, have been writing my comments as I go :carousel_horse: :sparkles:
  * KW: WAY TO GO! Thank you!
* For the DAS project I learnt quite a lot about the data, produced some nice graphs. :art:
  * KW: They look great...although not what we'd expect from the data :unamused:

#### What did you struggle with?

* Understanding the structural covariance network analysis with respect to brain science
  * KW: Definitely difficult if you can't access the papers!! Try [Unpaywall](http://unpaywall.org/) and see if there are green open access versions of the papers. Here's a [bunch of information](http://osc.cam.ac.uk/open-access) about open access at Cambridge if you're interested.
* TypeErrors :moyai:
  * KW: WELL DONE!
* I feel that this week I got bogged down a lot in programming issues
  * KW: Just keep pushing! :punch:

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I'd like to get the structural covariance blog written up (:watch: a couple of days. There is quite a lot to do here, not just in terms of getting the visualisations going, but also explaining (and understanding!) what is going on.
  * KW: GREAT! Thank you.
* For the DAS project I still need to check a sample of the data for accuracy (:watch:  a few hours, I fear)
  * KW: Yes, great plan. I'd suggest starting with papers that have a lot of references and are open access. Eg from PlosOne.
* Try to estimate how long each task will take.
  * KW: If you figure this out, please do let me know :neutral_face:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Would benefit from talking about structural covariance networks, where the data comes from etc. (:watch: maybe an hour some time next week?)
  * KW: absolutely.

#### Any other topics

### Date: 12th May 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

* I did some analysis of the DAS data that has been interesting
  * KW: Yaaaaay! Super exciting!
  * KW Q: What is Beautiful Soup!? Where's the name from?
    * IS: It seems to come from Alice in Wonderland, see [here](http://www.authorama.com/alice-in-wonderland-10.html), I'm still not really sure why.

#### Who helped you this week?

* :sparkles: Kirstie :sparkles:
* Hieu and Darren helped me by giving me material for the Whitakerlab blog.
* Barbara helped a lot yesterday with getting me started on the DVS project
* Amerik gave me a pass to the office!
* People in general have been very friendly

#### What did you achieve?

* Introduced myself to a lot of people!
* Started an introduction to Neuroimaging reading list
* Got a good start on processing DVS files
  * KW: YAAAAY! :sparkling_heart:
    * Processed xml file, got distribution of dates of articles, journal titles look sensible! YAAAAY (again).

#### What did you struggle with?

* Convincing people to say something for the blog
  * KW: Possible suggestion for next time is to not make the write up of the conversations public, it could be a report rather than a public facing blog post.
  * Interesting challenge between not wanting to bother people and writing something that (potentially) many others will see!
* Understanding neuroimaging. I don't feel like I've gotten very far
* Time management? Handling having a lot of different things to think about (and remember to do!)

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finishing running and wiki-ing structural covariance analysis (+ maybe a python notebook?) (a few days I think)
  * KW: Work in jupyter notebook to demonstrate use of code. Copy over data from PNAS paper to use as example input etc. Can also be used for code tests (either now or in the future).
* Exploring the DVS dataset (depends how far I want to go)
  * KW: Keep exploring! See what's there!
  * Next step is to write out the data in a cleaner format (eg csv file). Meeting planned with Barbara next week.
  * Possibly move on to doing analyses (although depends on how much time the cleaning takes).


#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* With the structural covariance analysis- in particular I'm wondering how much detail to go into in explanation.
  * KW: See above about jupyter notebook - best explanation is through demonstration! If you can write up a blog post that has some screen shots of the jupyter notebook that would be great.
  * Try not to write too much! The goal of the blog post is to help readers understand why they might want to do structural covariance network analyses. Sections might include:
    * Motivation
    * Building the network
    * Creating a graph
    * Calculating global and nodal measures
    * Visualising the network
  * There's a challenge for the blog post around how to include a small amount of useful background information motivating *why* we would want to do structural covariance network analyses....take a look at the Network Neuroscience reading list - in particular Alexander-Bloch et al's Nature Review's Neuroscience paper in 2013:  [doi: 10.1038/nrn3465](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n5/full/nrn3465.html)
    * Side note: please add this paper to the Network Neuroscience reading list.

#### Any other topics

What's going to happen in June? How should I spend my time while Kirstie's is traveling?
* KW: Take ownership of DVS project - really explore the data and look for insights. Also potentially explore network measures between two groups (probably by implementing permutation test between them).
