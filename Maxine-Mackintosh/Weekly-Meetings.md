### Date: 1 October 2018

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped a few PhD students who are just starting out with some bit of supposed tacet knowledge the system presents you with
* I helped some enrichment students with accomodation problems/sofas to crash as well as random bits and bobs like the existance of the Trainline app
  * KW: These are LOVELY helpful actions. THANK YOU :sparkling_heart:
* I helped a PhD student realise pretty much every joke he made was sexist. Ah well.
  * KW: And this one is good for the world and super frustrating for you. Thank you though!
  
#### Who helped you this week?

* JH helped me understand the interface of GitHub and agile project management
* KW helped me make my visualisations clearer despite my ggplot inadequacies
* General PhD students and business team helped me by smiling, making me feel welcome, having good senses of humour, complimenting my clothes and generally being luuuush to hang around with
  * KW: YAAAAAY! :sparkles:
  
#### What did you achieve?

* I managed to integrate multiple reviewers' comments on the first draft of my prodromal dementia paper...many months after I had hoped
* I think I genuinely made quite big steps towards more neatly and coherently assimilating a large volume of results for a clinical audience
* I reduced my GitHub anxiety by a teensy weensy little bitty bit

#### What did you struggle with?

* Remembering what I had written, and why in my paper... and then dealing with the boredom of agonising over minutiae bits of the paper 
* GitHub (unless you hadnt realised by now)
* Not crashing and breaking Overleaf whilst I decide how to appease a wide spectrum of supervisors' favourite writing places
  * KW: Note to self: required solution is word!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Next week is not really normal work week as I am attending an NHS Digital meeting on Monday, I have a 3 day "datathon" and then my sister is getting married. With that said however, at the Alzheimer's Innovation Workshop I want to:
*   Get familiar with useful tools for a datathon-type environment
*   Meet lots of fellow dementia/data nerds to examine me, collaborate with me, generlaly hang out with me
*   Start to develop a better understanding of how you build actual "stuff" through aforementioned tools and a smooth end-to-end analysis 
*   Learn about either genetics or imaging in AD and how that can complement my project (as I think thats the DPUK data we are using)
*   Get some ideas for ENRICHING (tick!) this year's projects

* I will also be reviewing a whole bunch of abstracts for the King's Fund Digital Health & Care congress, unfortunately over the datathon days so will be a few late nights for sure

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Nowhere really other than comments back on the paper (ideally faster than in 4 months)
* Maaaaaybe advice on whether I should set an MSc project for the Institute of Health Informatics students. They need way more projects set and it would be this summer but don't know if it's a good idea/worth it given my PhD timeline

#### Any other topics

* SD has got his MSc students 6 months free for Data Camp (which I luuurve) so might try and more systematically learn a few things... currently undecided which as I've enrolled on just about everything
