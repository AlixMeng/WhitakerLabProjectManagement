### Proposal summary

**Title** *(10 words)*: Brain Networks in Python

**List your partners, if any, and the role/s they will play.** *(250 words)*

I will be mentored by Dr Kirstie Whitaker. Kirstie is a research fellow at the Turing Institute and outgoing Mozilla Fellow for Science. She is a neuroscientist who studies brain development, using graph theory to understand the brain as a network. Dr Whitaker is a two time mentor for the Mozilla Open Leadership Training Program and she has extensive skills in nurturing and supporting open projects. The Brain Networks in Python is built within the Whitaker Lab GitHub repository where Dr Whitaker is an active contributor. She will review all code and documentation and provide guidance to ensure the Brain Networks In Python project is accessible and usable for all.

* Tomas? Martin O'Reilly? RSE team at Turing?

### Proposal description

**Describe the issue/problem you are trying to address.** *(100 words)*

Something something need to make it easier to do analyses in a reproducible way.

**List key project activities (what you will do), outputs (what will be produced through your activities) and outcomes (impact of your project on your beneficiaries during the grant period).** *(1000 words)*

Modularise code.

Add tests.

Add new functionality - permutation testing between groups.

Dynamic visualisations.

Provide documentation and examples.

Blog posts and promotion to the community.

**Provide key indicators you plan to use to measure project outcomes and source of data.** *(500 words)*

Gooooooood question. I'm not sure. Probably the best would be some papers to come out of it!

* Simone?
* Paula?
* Kirstie NORA

**Explain who will benefit from the project.** *(100 words)*

AAAAAALSO A good question. Scientists. People wanting to study brain as a complex network. Network analysists who want to apply their methods to brain networks?


**List any risks or challenges that may affect the overall success of your project and now how Mozilla and/or others can help you to overcome these challenges.** *(250 words)*

These are ALL VERY GOOD POINTS.

Probably the biggest challenge is that it is not usable for others - currently code works perfectly for the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network but requires Kirstie's idiosyncratic knowledge! Best way forward is to link into the Mozilla network and get early feedback from the community.

**Is this a new project or continuation? If new, please describe your qualifications to initiate the activity. If continued, please describe your accomplishments to date. Feel free to include links to articles and documents online that highlight your recent work.** *(1000 words)*

Continuation of Kirstie's work. INSERT DESCRIPTION OF PNAS PAPER.

New for Isla. INSERT expertise re: graph theory & networks etc.

**Mozilla works in the open. How will you document and share your project progress with the community.** *(250 words)*

GitHuuuuuuub. Already there. Twitter account for lab.


**How will you continue work on this project beyond the funding period?** *(250 words)*

We hope that users will continue to contribute. Kirstie will be able to mentor contributions.

Isla....applying for other funding?

Importantly - doesn't need to be "me". Whole point of building documentation openly is so that others can fork and contribute even if Isla leaves!
