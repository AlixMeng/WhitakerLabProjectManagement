### Date: 14th July 2017

#### Who did you help this week?

It doesn't feel like I did a whole bunch of helpful stuff this week. I mostly helped future me by writing down all the things I did to get the HPHI working! I also peer reviewed two papers & helped SM with MRI processing. (That was mostly Kirstie of the past making a protocols.io page! YEAAAH :raised_hands:)

#### Who helped you this week?

IH, IS & BMcG are doing great work on the DAS project & I'm excited about that. Had a good meeting w PV & SW about plans going forwards.

#### What did you achieve?

* Peer reviewed 2 papers
* Got slurm code written for HPHI & documented a bunch of steps
* Got pysurfer working on HPHI
* Got some emails cleaned up - finally

#### What did you struggle with?

* Emails (as usual)
* Fitting everything into the day (same as above really). Couldn't find 10 hours to work on longitudinal data.
* The HPHI is difficult to deal with but I'm making progress there. The good thing is that very few other people are using it so you get up on the queue very quickly!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Some results for meeting w Ed on Tuesday - gonna give it 2 hours on Monday and see what happens
* Some plans for the data management meeting on Tuesday - 2 hours on Tuesday morning
* Fragile families, would be nice to see if we can get a big push to the end??
* Blog posts encouraging people to apply for OpenCon, Moz leaders & MozFest
* BrainAge!
