### Date: 24th January 2018

#### What did you struggle with?

* Oooph, this was a hard week, I was tired for much of it and let a lot of balls fall
  * I shouldn't have said yes to the teaching. It was a nice thing for me to do but it really didn't respect my time well at all which was a big mistake
* NSPN analyses as usual are a bit bonkers & always take longer than you think
* Dropped the ball on getting feedback to an application and feel really bad about it

#### Where do you need help?

* Keeping focused and not doing all the analyses -just the right ones (as usual)
* Finding someone to take over the talk!!

#### Any other topics

I'm really enjoying monitoring my time, I think it really helps me to think carefully about what I'm focusing on.

I'd like to work harder at keeping my project board up to date, including with PRs/issues from various other repos. Not sure how best to do that, but probably just setting aside time and searching through notifications/ones assigned to me?
