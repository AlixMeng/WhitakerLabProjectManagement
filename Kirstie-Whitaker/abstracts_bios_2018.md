### Science on Screen: The Imitation Game

**Website**: https://www.crick.ac.uk/whats-on/upcoming-events/2018/01/10/science-on-screen-the-imitation-game/

**Date**: 10th January 2018

**Bio**: Dr Whitaker is a Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. She uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development. She is a Fulbright scholarship alumna, a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows) and in June will ride for the tenth time in the [AIDS/Lifecycle](http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/kirstie) bike ride - 545 miles from San Francisco to LA to raise money to fight HIV/AIDS and eliminate the stigma associated with the virus. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for diversity in academia and tech, including support for LGBTQ+ members of our community.

### Role in data study group

**Role**: Dr Kirstie Whitaker focuses on participant engagement within the data study group. The whole team believes strongly in the power of collaborative working and Dr Whitaker is a particularly passionate advocate for increased diversity in data science. During the data study group week she acts as a meta-facilitator - a facilitator of the facilitators - and provides training and support for the PhD students who take on the task of project managing a team from a wide range of backgrounds and skills. She was a 2016 Mozilla Fellow for Science, one of just four awarded that year worldwide, and has spoken internationally on how to make science and technology development more equitable. A key contribution that Dr Whitaker brought to the DSG team was a clearly defined code of conduct that made explicit the data study group's focus on inclusivity and making sure there is space at the Alan Turing Institute for all participants to contribute their best work. She has supported the writing and delivery of high quality reports that clearly detail all the research conducted during the DSG week.

### Talk at Leeds Beckett

**Website**: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/psycen-seminar-a-how-to-guide-to-reproducible-research-tickets-41866131727

**Date**: 14th February 2018

**Title**: A how to guide to reproducible research

**Abstract**: This talk will discuss the perceived and actual barriers experienced by researchers attempting to do reproducible research, and give practical guidance on how they can be overcome. It will include suggestions on how to make your code and data available and usable for others (including a strong suggestion to document both clearly so you don't have to reply to lots of email questions from future users). Specifically it will include a brief guide to version control, collaboration and dissemination using GitHub as well as a discussion of tools to help you work reproducibly from the start in a variety of programming languages. Exercises and resources will be persistently available after the talk and all audience members will leave knowing there is something they can do to step towards making their research reproducible.

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK). She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Bristol and an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia. She was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge from 2012 to 2017. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and is a passionate advocate for reproducible neuroscience. She is a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows). Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.

### Invited talk at CUBRIC

**Date**: 29th March 2018

**Title**: Structural brain development during adolescence and its relation to psychiatric disorders

**Abstract**: Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. I will present my work within the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN; www.nspn.org.uk) on cortical myelination between the ages of 14 and 24. I will show, consistently in two cohorts, that age-related changes in adolescence are concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the human structural connectome. I will demonstrate the power of integrating open data sets such as the Allen Brain Atlas with non-invasive imaging techniques: specifically by linking the expression of schizophrenia risk genes to adolescent brain development.
