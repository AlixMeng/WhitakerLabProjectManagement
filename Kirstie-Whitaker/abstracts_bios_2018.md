# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of all the talk abstracts and bios I write for events in 2018.

Hopefully I'll be able to re-use at least some of them ;)

They're ordered by date of presentation so ideally they're a little easier to find.

### Science on Screen: The Imitation Game

**Website**: https://www.crick.ac.uk/whats-on/upcoming-events/2018/01/10/science-on-screen-the-imitation-game/

**Date**: 10th January 2018

**Bio**: Dr Whitaker is a Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and senior research associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. She uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development. She is a Fulbright scholarship alumna, a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows) and in June will ride for the tenth time in the [AIDS/Lifecycle](http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/kirstie) bike ride - 545 miles from San Francisco to LA to raise money to fight HIV/AIDS and eliminate the stigma associated with the virus. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for diversity in academia and tech, including support for LGBTQ+ members of our community.


### Talk at Leeds Beckett

**Website**: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/psycen-seminar-a-how-to-guide-to-reproducible-research-tickets-41866131727

**Date**: 14th February 2018

**Title**: A how to guide to reproducible research

**Abstract**: This talk will discuss the perceived and actual barriers experienced by researchers attempting to do reproducible research, and give practical guidance on how they can be overcome. It will include suggestions on how to make your code and data available and usable for others (including a strong suggestion to document both clearly so you don't have to reply to lots of email questions from future users). Specifically it will include a brief guide to version control, collaboration and dissemination using GitHub as well as a discussion of tools to help you work reproducibly from the start in a variety of programming languages. Exercises and resources will be persistently available after the talk and all audience members will leave knowing there is something they can do to step towards making their research reproducible.

**Bio**: Kirstie Whitaker is a Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK). She completed her PhD in Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley in 2012 and holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Bristol and an MSc in Medical Physics from the University of British Columbia. She was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge from 2012 to 2017. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and is a passionate advocate for reproducible neuroscience. She is a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships/fellows). Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker) by Foreign Policy magazine.

At CW18, Kirstie will talk about culture change based on her long journey as an open science advocate. You may have met her in the past at events like [Better Science through Better Data 2017](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/better-science-through-better-data-2017-scidata17-tickets-32719974324#) or at the annual [OpenCon satellite workshops in Cambridge](http://www.openconcam.org/) that she has organised from 2015. She is a passionate advocate for improving the representation of women and other under-represented groups in STEM fields, and won the runner up prize of the [Rosalind Franklin App Competition](https://www.i-sense.org.uk/events/all/rosalind-franklin-appathon-prize-and-tech-day-2016) in 2016 for the STEMM Role Models project ([www.stemmrolemodels.com](http://stemmrolemodels.com/)) that seeks to ensure conference organisers are able to invite the most exciting and diverse speakers to their event.

The Collaborations Workshop 2018 will run from Monday 26th to Wednesday 28th March 2018 at [The School of Mathematics, Cardiff University](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/mathematics/about-us/our-location). Registration is open on the [CW18 Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/collaborations-workshop-2018-cw18-collabw18-tickets-38380767910?aff=20171201keynote1KirstieWhitaker).
