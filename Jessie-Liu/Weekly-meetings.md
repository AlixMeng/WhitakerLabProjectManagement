* Kirstie, thank you very much for giving me the chance to go the MozFest, really special experience for me! :sparkling_heart:
* Went to an interesting workshop at MozFest called "An Introduction to Neurohacking". The facilitator of the session talked to me for a while explaining me how their product works, how EEG works, whats the potencial use of it.

#### What did you achieve?
* More analysis on HCP work.
* A draft paper! :smiley:
* If this counts, a PhD progress report as well (lots of writing anyway...)
  * This TOTALLY counts! WAY TO GO! :sparkles:

KW: This is a gif to say WAY TO GO on all the writing!! ERMEGERD well done :smile:
