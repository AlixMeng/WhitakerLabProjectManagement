#### Who helped you this week?
* AB1 (and MOR & MY) helped me so much on cluster computing. Im really thankful for his time!
  * KW: :raised_hands::raised_hands::raised_hands: Thank you!
* AB2 spent some time with me on figuring out some Matlab plot setting. Although it wasnt solved in the end, I still appreciate for his help.

* Kirstie, thank you very much for giving me the chance to go the MozFest, really special experience for me! :sparkling_heart:
* Went to an interesting workshop at MozFest called "An Introduction to Neurohacking". The facilitator of the session talked to me for a while explaining me how their product works, how EEG works, whats the potencial use of it.

#### What did you achieve?
* More analysis on HCP work.
* A draft paper! :smiley:
* If this counts, a PhD progress report as well (lots of writing anyway...)

* Finish writing the paper... wasnt easy in time management (always wanted to do more analysis), the structure the writing (logic, order, what to put in) and so on.
  * KW: Totally understand, everyone feels this way. But this is the path to the end. WAY TO GO.
  * This is what I use to help me concentrate on writing: [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Here's a timer that I like: http://e.ggtimer.com/pomodoro

#### What would you like to work on next week?
* Going to present a paper in Oxford next week. I need to prepare for it.

* Some plan on what we are going to do :wave:
  * KW: Yes, what an interesting idea :grimacing:!!
    * Next time we meet please present the demographics of the biobank database (w imaging ideally) and a summary of the brain and behavioural measures you're interested in. We'll pick an easy plan of attack from there :smile:
* Looking for git tutorial to go with github tutorial

(*super cool stuff*), and am really motivated of following a similar path (there am I).
  * KW: So kind! I'm so glad :blush:
* NK showed me his cool way of managing project with very systemized approach, including what kind of text editor, github repo, terminal app etc.
