A list of resources (in progress!) for understanding how MRI is used for Neural Imaging

The [nipype-beginner's guide](http://miykael.github.io/nipype-beginner-s-guide/neuroimaging.html) has, for me, been the most helpful thing after Kirstie's megalesson. (Thank you Kirstie :tada: and thank you Miykael :sparkles:)

The Neuroimaging [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging) has been helpful

An Absolute Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Surface- and Voxel-based Morphometric Analysis [link](http://cds.ismrm.org/protected/11MProceedings/files/ISMRM2011-8410.pdf)


This is an excellent resource for understanding the physics behind MRIs [e-MRI](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-Courses/e-MRI)
