### Introductions to Reproducibility
Slides by Tom Hardwicke. Science as a Human Edeavour/ Building a Reproducible Research Workflow [Slides](https://osf.io/rxwsp/). This has a nice, easy summary of threats to research.
Slides by Courtney Soderberg. Practical Steps for Increasing Openness and Reproducibility. [Slides](https://osf.io/br8d4/)
FiveThirtyEight’s [Hack Your Way To Scientific Glory](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking/) : striking online demonstration of p-hacking in action!
